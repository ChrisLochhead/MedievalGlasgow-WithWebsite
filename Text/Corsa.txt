<h3>Overview</h3>
Like all great heroes, <a href="wiki.html?myVar=Gareth of Dunbar">Dunbar</a> has his noble steed. Lu Bu had Red Hare, Geralt of Rivea had Roach, and Dunbar has his Corsa. It is unknown the meaning of her name, 
but some legends suggest it is named after something unreliable, cheap and breaks every five thousand miles. This is an apt description of Corsa.
<br><br>
Corsa is an old horse, over 10 years old and said to have galloped over sixty thousand miles in her lifetime. This has made her prone to frequent leg breaks and
hoof replacements among other ailments. Nevertheless, Dunbar refuses to give up on his work horse, primarily because he has yet to finish paying the finance on 
her as the local stable master locked him into a 28% APR finance deal.

<h3>Biography</h3>
Corsa began life as a steed in the employ of Lord Lochburn and was his personal horse. Trained as a warhorse, Corsa was small yet reliable and incredibly manouverable,
saving the life of Lochburn through its robust movement many times in battle.
<br><br>
By the time of Lochburns death, Corsa was already an old horse, over ten years old. When the life expectancy for humans is barely higher than this age in Possil, it can be
safely assumed that Corsa's health was nothing short of dire by this point. Gareth nonetheless bought Corsa at a brutally inflated price after she was auctioned by the state
after Lochburns death.
<br><br>
Shortly before the events of Legend of Dunbar, Gareth was out with Corsa going for a mild stroll to exercise the horse, ready for their journey from Possil, when her front legs 
suddenly folded like deck chairs, crumpling under their own weight. This would not be the last time Corsa suffered such an accident, with it being the cause for Dunbars death
years after the events of the game.
