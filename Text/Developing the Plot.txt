Besides doing the revision lab for HTML and CSS, the majority of my study time this week was spend working on plot development
and developing a story to fit our chosen setting and game genre. As the game is supposed to be multiplayer, I knew firstly I 
had to come up with 2 main characters to base the story around.
<br><br>
<h3 class = "tm-blogpost-subtitle">Gareth of Dunbar</h3>
<br>
While still a working title, Gareth of Dunbar will be the main character of this name. Gareth of Dunbar is based on a member of the CGT 
course and a personal friend who lives in Possil Park. I discussed with him the idea and he, along with the inspiration for the second
main character, were more than happy to be used as inspiration for our game. The next working title as of writing this is Gareth De Wyndford:
The Wyndford is a river that runs through Maryhill near Possil Park and makes for a more satirically regal sounding name to the uninitated.
<br><br>
<h3 class = "tm-blogpost-subtitle">Dave 'O' Summerston</h3>
<br>
Like Dunbar, Dave is based on another CGT member and resident of Summerston, hence the name. These two are extremely close friends who have
known eachother an incredibly long time, a bond we intend to use as inspiration for the brotherly comradeship demonstrated by these two
main characters.
<br>
While writing the first draft of the GDD, I settled on a rough story for the game, told through a main quest line four adventures long.
Questing seemed to be the most appropriate way to deliver the narrative of the game as it is an ideal storytelling method used and almost
all open-world games from Runescape to Grand Theft Auto. Four quests were agreed by myself and Niclas to be a good number for a manageable 
amount of content within the timeframe we have been given. 
<br>
So the story will essentially be Gareth and Dave in their journey to collect enough money to pay the vet bill on Gareths horse, Corsa. Only
with Corsa's leg fixed can Gareth and Dave finally leave Possil for better opportunities and a better life in general. The four quests are
taken from the local seer "Gando the Grey", based on a person called "Gando" who is reportedly quite infamous in the Possil area for his antics
and are as follows:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The first quest will involve finding the components of and making a potion to give to Gando to relieve him of the effects of Magic Mushrooms
so that he will be legible enough to speak to properly.</li> 
<li>The second quest will be running an errand for Gando to fix his back which leaves him permanently bent at a 90 degree angle. This quest however
will feature combat.</li>
<li> Quest number three will be defeating a monster that has been terrorising the residents of Possil.</li>
<li> The final quest will feature Gando as the final boss after discovering it was him who released the monster in quest three on Possil in the first
place.</li>
</ul>
<br>
This is the rough outline of the story as of week two, the full fleshed out story will be contained within the GDD available on this site in 
the "Design" section. The plan for next week is to finish the draft of this GDD and pass it on to Niclas, finish my website and begin learning
Javascript in anticipation for building the game itself.
