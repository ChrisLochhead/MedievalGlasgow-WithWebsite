<h3>Overview</h3>
Dave 'O' Summerston is the secondary playable character in Medieval Glasgow and is the long time companion of <a href="wiki.html?myVar1=Gareth of Dunbar">Gareth of Dunbar</a>.
He accompanies Dunbar on his quest to get funds for <a href = "wiki.html?myVar=Corsa">Corsa's</a> leg, partly due to their long lasting brotherhood, and also because Dave has no other means of transport without
Dunbars Horse.
<br><br>
Settling in the keep of Summerston, Dave and his family are low level nobles who live in a gigantic tower, among many other noble families, in single story accomodation.
Almost like a sort of flat house, that is high up, like a sort of "High flat". 
<br><br>
Similarly broke like Dunbar as are most of the residents of Possil, Dave has learned to master the art of herblore in order to make ends meet, primarily cultivating and
selling various herbs of questionable legality. Nonetheless, Dave envisions a better life for himself beyond the realm of Possil that he only has to reach out and grasp.

<h3>Biography</h3>
Born in 981AD a commoner without two pennies to rub together, Dave was given a rough start in life. Despite his blessing of a full family for support, he was thoroughly
inside the peasant class of Possil, with an average life expectancy lower than the current age of anyone capable of reading this sentence. Nevertheless, even without
the formal noble education recieved by knights like Dunbar, Dave still grew into an effective sell-sword to support himself.

While serving north for in the army of a local baron, Summerston perfected his art of herblore as he would often forage the woods creating herbal remedies to treat the wounds
of his allies. As this was 981AD, most of these concoctions were useless at best and caused violent death at worst, however as was common at the time Dave was heralded by those
who knew him as an expert medical professional.
<br>
While out on campaign in the more noble realm East of the fiefdom of Glasgow, Dave perfected his magic based combat style; employing sneaking tactics along with offensive magic 
which would devastate his enemies despite his relatively small and malnourished stature.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
Like Dunbar, Dave is based on another CGT student of the same name upon his consent to have himself used in this game. As Dunbar was devised to be the chivalric knight in a 
medieval fantasy game where magic was prevalent, it became obvious that having a mage based second player would be required. Summerston fills this role and provides a dynamic
combat balance between the main two players, while leaving potential for expansion in the form of future playable characters without making the team feel incomplete before 
any additional characters are implemented.
