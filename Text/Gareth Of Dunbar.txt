<h2>Overview</h2>
Gareth of Dunbar, head of the Dunbar homestead since the mysterious dissapearance of his father after a routine journey to the tobacco stall, is a minor noble
of Possil and the main character of Medieval Glasgow. Bent on his determination to escape the land of Possil for the land of Upper Pais, Dunbar finds himself
on a journey of self discovery in his quest to make ends meet.
<br><br>
Along with his trusted companion, <a href="wiki.html?myVar1=Dave O Summerston">Dave O Summerston </a>, Dunbar has smited various foes such as the Ny-claws, 
countless brigands while working his day job at ye olde Tesco and even Gando the Grey himself.
<br><br>
Seldom seen in the game due to injury, Dunbars family horse and oldest friend is his black steed "Corsa". Corsa is a ten year old black stallion that has
frankly seen better days. Nonetheless, Dunbars trusty Corsa has served him well and continues to, despite her failing health.

<h2>Biography</h2>
Born in 980AD, Gareth was born to Maurice de Wyndford and an unknown knight. The knight is at this point unknown as he was killed in battle before young
Dunbars birth. Born into minor nobility, Gareth was trained as a Knight, squiring under Lord Lochburn. Lochburn treated Gareth like his son and at some
point had even willed his vast estate of Lochburn gate to the teenage Dunbar. Unfortunately, the mystical fiends of Gilshohill murdered Lochburn in his sleep
and burned down his vast castle, leaving nothing but charred ruins of the once stunningly marble estate.

Gareth returned upon his knighthood to his mothers domicile when these events unfolded, leaving Dunbar without prospects, inheritence or direction. Re-uniting
with Dave O Summerston, a childhood friend of Dunbars who was a well known sellsword, they set out on their adventure in 1002AD to visit the fabled
<a href="wiki.html?myVar1=Gando the Grey">Gando the grey</a> in the central market of Possil.
<br><br>
It is currently unknown the events that unfolded with Gando and whether Gareth ever escaped Possil in his youth. What is known however is how he died. At the
ripe old age of 32, 10 years above the Possil life expectancy, Gareth died after Corsa had a heart attack mid gallop, throwing Gareth 50ft infront on her where
he exploded in a spectacular fashion through the window of the Possil Orphanage. The resulting carnage caused the candles of the room he crashed into to fall,
igniting the Orphanage and destroying the entire building. The place was sucessfully evacuated, with the only casualties being Dunbar and his Corsa.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
Dunbar is based on a member of the CGT course who gave his consent to have the character and story based loosely upon himself. The original Gareth lives in Possil
and drives a Vauxhall Corsa, hence the name of his horse. The names of his mother and areas within the land are however entirely fabricated and based upon real-life
locations in Glasgows west-end.
