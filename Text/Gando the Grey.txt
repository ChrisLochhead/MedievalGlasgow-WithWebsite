<h3>Overview</h3>
Ganduis Oreillius de Grey (Gando the Grey) is the seer of Possil, serving as both the political and cultural heart of the realm. Famous for his exploits, his behaviour of late
has become more and more erratic and unbecoming of the de-facto political leader of Possil. Known for his thick accent and impossibly bent-over back, Gando is a powerful mage
who is also incredibly insightful and wise.

<h3>Biography</h3>
Records begin with Gando already being a grey haired old man, some say he is as old as time itself. These legend come from Possil however, a place where making it past the age of 
13 is a rewardable accolade and grey haired people with normal looking teeth are often looked upon with suspicion. Every historical record of Possil contains reference to Gando
appearing on the high street, giving out insightful commentary, earning coin or simply just making his presence known.

Prior to the events of The legend of Dunbar, Gando had consolidated his power in Possil, amassing tremendous wealth from the peasantry, building himself a grand tower on the high
street and surrounding himself with a private security detail. Gando has also bribed his way into political power in Possil, taken from the grand council of Glasgow for a small price
as the council had given up on Possil largely from its inception.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
Gando is a satirical commentary on the larger than life people you are likely to meet on the streets of Glasgow and as such his personality and behaviour was assembled from a number
of well known figures in the Glasweigan community. Gando was also inspired from "Mom" from Futurama and the Emperor from the Star wars Franchise in that, he conveys himself initially
as a harmless old man full of wisdom and empathy, despite being power hungry and evil behind the facade.
