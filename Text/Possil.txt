<h3>Overview</h3>
Possil is an ancient realm constructed in the dawn of the millenia by a group of flourescent druids known only as "the workies". The original construction of Possil was shoddy, and the 
result at the time of the legend of Dunbar is a rubble filled town full of abandoned buildings and derelict areas. As a result of its geography, Possil is home not only to humans, but
a myriad of evil beings such as vampires, fiends and Orcs. 
<br><br>
Ruled by <a href="wiki.html?myVar="Gando the Grey">Gando the Grey</a>, Possil has been in a perpetual state of poverty for most of its existence, with most of its income being siphoned by Gandos administration to inflate his own
personal wealth, however the public at large are completely unaware of this situation, believing Gando to be doing all he can to improve the situation for Possil and its citizens.
<br><br>
There are multiple districts in Possil; Maryhill, Lochburn estate, Gilshohill, Summerston and Possil proper. While areas such as Lochburn and Summerston were once areas lived in by
nobility with large sprawling castle complexes, they are now mostly rubble and refugees from southern wars like the rest of Possil.
<br><br>
At the time of Legend of Dunbar, Possil is near breaking point. After years of mismanagement and bad financial policies on the part of Gando, the peasantry live in a near constant
state of anarchy. Fights resulting in death are common, offensive magic is used on the street and race relations between humans and the other species native to Possil are at an all
time high. 
<br><br>
A small resistance movement, aware of Gando's oppressive dictatorship and resistant to his magical influence has formed in the district of Maryhill where they operate. This group's
stated aim is to destroy Gando however the resistance cell is small and poorly known, largely due to the effective propaganda machine managed my the Grey Gando. Its leader is a man
known only as Sir Lochhart, an exiled noble from the fiefdom of Glasgow.
