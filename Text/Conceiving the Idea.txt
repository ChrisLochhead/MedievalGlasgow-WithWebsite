This week began a new module named Web Games Development 2: the second part of a web games development
class. While my course was not given the first part of this course, CGD was so I realised immediately
that the learning curve may be quite steep. We were then given a run down of the requirements for this module. 
Firstly we were to assemble into groups of two to four and come up with a concept for a game that we can develop
and deploy on a web page. We also have to compose a thorough GDD documenting this game as a group and individually 
develop websites to host the game on.

Myself and Niclas, having teamed up for every group coursework in fourth year done so again for this module. We
briefly considered joining with two others on our course however in our experience larger groups lead to more being
expected of us and far harsher marking. Not only that but a group of four would require the designation of a leader
and co-ordinating our work effort would be more difficult.

<h3 class = "tm-blogpost-subtitle">The Game</h3>
The first order of business was to determine what genre of game we would make. We didn't want to settle with a generic
racing or shooting game as no doubt most people typically would as indicated by the lecturer: we instead opted for a 
small RPG fantasy adventure game. Our lecturer stressed that the game try to include some unique functionality,
so we opted for an RPG due to the versatility the genre offers in terms of gameplay. We decided we would implement
a crafting system, some puzzle based gameplay and a combat system to give the gameplay ample depth.

Next to figure out was the plot of the story. I had previously made a text-based game which served as a satirical
commentary of life in Glasgow and we thought injecting the game with some comedy would help our game stand out. As
a result, we decided on a game based in the Possil Park district of Glasgow but in the setting of a medieval fantasy.
The basic idea of the plot became that it would be about a resident of this area trying to escape to a better life,
combating the sheer lunacy of the ancient realm of Possil's residents.

In terms of style, we decided that low-definition designs such as pixel-art would be the way to go for a number of 
reasons. Firstly, pixel-art was easy to create quickly as there is only two of us and less than 3 months to create
this entire game including the website and GDD. We also wanted the game to be reminiscent of the old Pokemon games
available on the Gameboy and also have a game with assets light-weight enough to be effectively deployable in a 
multiplayer web game. Having the game be multiplayer is mandatory, so we decided we would have two base playable
character with their own backstories and strengths.

<h3 class = "tm-blogpost-subtitle">The Plan</h3>
We decided on a broad plan of action which was the following to be acheived by next week:
<br><br>
Chris
<ul style="list-style: circle;">
<li> Start work on the HTML5 training so Niclas can be helped when he goes to make his own</li>
<li> Make a rough draft of a game design document</li>
<li> Come up with a rough story line </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Niclas
<ul>
<li> Start work on Phazer to determine exactly what is possible and how steep the learning curve will be </li>
<li> Investigate similar games for inspiration and begin asset development</li>
<li> Brainstorm story ideas </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
If we can quickly achieve these initial goals we will no doubt be on good footing for this module and able to afford
ourselves ample time to learn the programming disciplines we will be subject to aswell.
