As the games design document is well underway and the website is basically finished, I began to look further
towards developing the game itself. Outside of this project, my Javascript knowledge is limited to the coding challenge
videos I have watched online and as such I have little practical experience of the language. I have also never even heard of
the Phaser engine before this year so I knew that the learning curve for this project may be steep. To this end I have decided
to start the implementation as early as possible in an attempt to mitigate the time-consuming problems I would likely face.

I decided to start small, get a repo working with Phaser, commit it to source control and start playing around with the functionality.
If I could get a moving player, a working inventory, gear and quest menu's I would have a solid foundation in both the game itself and my 
understanding of Javascript at large. As expected, I ran into significant problems such as learning to implicitly declare functions that use
Phaser functionality as they would not work unless used in a function recognised by the engine.

As of the writing of this blog, I have achieved the following:
<br>
<ul>
<li> A moving playing that rotates to which direction he is moving.</li>
<li> A fully functional gear tab for equiping and un-equipping armour and weapons</li>
<li> A partly functional inventory (only works for gear and not consumables or picking items of the ground yet</li>
<li> A partly functional quest menu (does not display any text, just lists the quests which can be clicked on to create an empty dialogue</li>
<li> A dynamic text box which can be opened and closed</li>
<li> Health and mana bars that update with the players current stat values</li>
</ul>

<br>
Niclas has implemented the source control and implemented xammp for our eventual multiplayer implementation. As of now for the next week
the plan is for Niclas to finish the redrafted GDD I gave him in the previous week and finish some basic assets to replace the placeholders
I am using currently. As for myself, I want to spend the next week finishing the inventory and tab system while potentially implementing some rudimentary
conversational functionality with NPCs.
