Like all great heroes, Dunbar has his noble steed. Lu Bu had Red Hare, Geralt of Rivea had Roach, and Dunbar has his Corsa. It is unknown the meaning of her name, but some legends suggest it is named after something unreliable, cheap and breaks every five thousand miles. This is an apt description of Corsa.
<br><br>
Corsa is an old horse, over 10 years old and said to have galloped over sixty thousand miles in her lifetime. This has made her prone to frequent leg breaks and hoof replacements among other ailments. Nevertheless, Dunbar refuses to give up on his work horse, primarily because he has yet to finish paying the finance on her as the local stable master locked him into a 28% APR finance deal.
