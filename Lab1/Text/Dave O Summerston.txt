Dave 'O' Summerston is the secondary playable character in Medieval Glasgow and is the long time companion of <a href="wiki.html?myVar1=Gareth of Dunbar">Gareth of Dunbar</a>. He accompanies Dunbar on his quest to get funds for Corsa's leg, partly due to their long lasting brotherhood, and also because Dave has no other means of transport without Dunbars Horse.

Settling in the keep of Summerston, Dave and his family are low level nobles who live in a gigantic tower, among many other noble families, in single story accomodation. Almost like a sort of flat house, that is high up, like a sort of "High flat".

Similarly broke like Dunbar as are most of the residents of Possil, Dave has learned to master the art of herblore in order to make ends meet, primarily cultivating and selling various herbs of questionable legality. Nonetheless, Dave envisions a better life for himself beyond the realm of Possil that he only has to reach out and grasp.
